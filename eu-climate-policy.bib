	abstract = {This paper provides an empirical analysis of the evidence of carbon leakage from the European primary aluminium industry during the first 6 ½ years of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme ({EU} {ETS}). The findings suggest that while rising electricity prices in several major producer countries in the {EU} have played a critical role in the rise in net imports of {EU} primary aluminium into the {EU} in recent years, the role of {CO}2 costs in this equation has been more limited than was expected in the ex-ante literature. Other factors, including rising primary energy prices and difficulties for primary smelters in obtaining long-term electricity-supply contracts, appear to have been more economically important factors than the relatively low {CO}2 costs which have been witnessed so far.},

	abstract = {I study the economic impact of the European Union Emission Trading Scheme ({EU} {ETS}) on the refining industry in Europe. I contrast previous ex-ante studies with the lessons from a series of interviews I conducted with industrials, and the public data available on the first phase of the scheme, effective from January 1st, 2005 to December 31st, 2007. I conclude that because of organizational inertia, weak incentives linked to the low emission permit price that prevailed during its second part, and important industrial and regulatory constraints, the Phase I of {EU} {ETS} has had a limited economic impact on firms. However, this first trading period was instrumental in allowing the rening sector to build the capabilities needed to respond efficiently to the carbon price signal in the long run. I argue that the internal and external constraints that this first phase revealed will shape the future outcome of the scheme. Based on evidence from the rening sector under {EU} {ETS}, I take position in the current debate over policy design to suggest ways for regulators to improve the economic impact and environmental effectiveness of carbon markets.},

	abstract = {In Europe, about a third of the total final energy demand of the industrial sector is used for the generation of low temperature heat below 100 °C which could be satisfied by commercially available solar thermal applications. Although the technological readiness level of solar thermal technologies is currently in high levels, the recent energy mix data of industrial countries with high solar irradiation levels reveal that this potential still remains untapped. The key objective of this work is to quantify this unexploited potential and assess the environmental impact of industrial solar thermal systems ({ISTS}). Under this context, cradle-to-use Life Cycle Assessment ({LCA}) was conducted for the definition of the environmental performance of {ISTS}. A parametric analysis for the application of {ISTS} at selected European sites with diverse solar potential was also implemented to investigate the impact of solar potential on the life cycle performance of the systems. Taking into consideration the findings on the potential of carbon savings from the application of {ISTS} and in relevance to the European Union Emissions Trading System ({EU} {ETS}), scenarios of {ISTS} penetration and monetization into the industrial sector have also been developed. The findings of this work can be used by policy-makers as guidelines for the development of national strategic plans and financial incentives for the promotion of large-scale industrial solar thermal applications. The implementation of a parametric assessment on the environmental performance of {ISTS} for specific European geographical locations of diverse solar potential enabled the development of a ‘Life Cycle Produced to Consumed Energy’ Ratio, which indicated that applications located at lower latitudes (in the northern hemisphere) can achieve greater life cycle energy and carbon savings than {ISTS} applications found higher in latitude. In particular, large-scale {ISTS} applications were found to achieve energy and carbon savings ranging from 35 to 75 {GJ} and 2–5 tonnes of {CO}2 per {kWth}, depending on the geographical location.},

	abstract = {Fear of lowering firms’ competitiveness and carbon leakage is the reason for large amounts of allowances in the European Union’s Emissions Trading System ({EU} {ETS}) still being allocated for free. At the same time, unadjusted free allocation of allowances in times of economic recession is partly responsible for the large surplus of allowances that has cumulated in the {EU} {ETS} and that is lowering prices in the market. For Phase {IV}, the introduction of dynamic allocation has been proposed to react to significant changes in production, to prevent the accumulation of further surplus on the one hand and to protect installations from severe underallocation on the other. A reserve of about 400 million allowances is planned for that purpose. This paper analyses the demand for certificates from this reserve under different assumptions on production development as well as different design options for Phase {IV}. The analysis builds on freely available allocation data from Phase {III} along with projections of production trends from different time periods in the past. In most of the scenarios, the 400 million allowances are sufficient to fulfil demand for allowances from dynamic allocation until at least the second half of Phase {IV} (often even for the whole of Phase {IV}). Even though certain aspects analysed are now not fully compatible with the agreed-upon Phase {IV} revision, the analysis indicates that the amount of allowances foreseen for dynamic allocation is sufficient for Phase {IV}. In particular the threshold value of 10\% that was introduced in the legislation will ensure that the demand of allowances is likely well below the demand found in the different scenarios in this analysis that neglects this threshold value.},
